This project is to create the game of "Lights Out". This is a single-player
game which consists of a 5x5 grid of lights. When the game starts, a random
selection of lights is switched on. Clicking any light will toggle it and the
four adjacent lights. The goal of the puzzle is to switch all the lights off
in as few button-presses as possible. The image below illustrates the game-play.

Have a look at the Minesweeper and Connect4 projects for hints on storing the
state of the lights.
