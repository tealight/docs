The aim of this project is to develop a digital pet. The pet should be 
semi-autonomous - it should have a life of its own, but also respond 
and depend on the owner (player). At the very basic level, your pet should 
be able to fall asleep when tired and need to be fed, but there is no limit 
to what else you can add (playing with a pet, pet getting 
ill, having multiple pets, etc.). For more inspiration, check the article 
on Tamagotchi in Wikipedia.

To start with, you should have two simple counters (for tiredness and hunger),
which should slowly be incremented over time, and reduced when the pet 
sleeps or eats. Your program should have buttons for interacting with the 
pet (feeding it, playing with it, etc.) and respond to them appropriately 
(update the counters, show animation, etc.). As an extension, you could 
consider how different levels of counters can interact with each other 
(e.g. maybe if the pet is hungry, it does not want to play?).
